        <h2>How to make Aloo Paratha</h2> 
        <p>Before you can make these delicious stuffed parathas, you need to prepare the potato stuffing and make the whole wheat dough.</p>
        <h3>Make Potato Stuffing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, boil or steam 4 medium-sized potatoes in a pressure cooker, steamer or electric cooker. Add enough water in a 2-litre pressure cooker or pan to just barely cover the potatoes.</li>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>cooking in a pressure cooker:</strong>On a medium heat, cook the potatoes in water for 3 to 4 whistles. When the pressure settles down naturally, remove the lid and drain the water very well. Allow the potatoes to cool enough to handle and then peel them.</li>
                <li><strong>For cooking in a pan:</strong>Cover the pan and cook potatoes in water till fork tender. For this method, it helps to peel the potatoes and chop them in 2 inch cubes before boiling because they will cook faster than whole potatoes. Using a colander, drain all the water and allow the potatoes to cool.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>If you haven’t done so yet, peel and chop the warm potatoes. Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher.</li>
            <li>The potatoes should be mashed very well, with no lumps, chunks or bits. Any lumps in the mix will cause the stuffing to leak out of the dough when rolling.</li>
            <li>Now add the following ingredients, feeling free to vary the spices as you like.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies) or serrano peppers</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon punjabi garam masala powder or Garam Masala Powder</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or cayenne pepper or paprika (optional)</li>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) – or use lemon juice instead</li>
                <li>salt according to your taste</li>
            </ul>
            <li>With a spoon, thoroughly mix the ground spices and green chilies into the mashed potatoes to get an even mixture. Set the prepared aloo stuffing aside.</li>

            <h2>Make The Dough</h2>
            <li>In a separate bowl, add 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta). Make a well in the center. Add ½ teaspoon salt (or to taste), 1 tablespoon oil or ghee, and roughly ⅓ to ½ cup water.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture together and knead into a smooth, soft dough for 8 to 10 minutes. Add more water if needed. Cover and keep the dough aside, letting it rest for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>    
            
            <h2>Stuff The Flatbread</h2>

            <li>Pinch two small balls from the dough. Flatten them and dust with whole wheat flour.</li>
            <li>With a rolling pin, roll them into rounds roughly 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Try making both the discs the same size.</li>
            <li>On one of the discs, place the potato stuffing in the center, keeping about 1 inch empty space from the sides.</li>
            <li>Gently place the second circle on top.</li>
            <li>Press and seal the edges with your fingertips. If you are not able to seal the edges, then brush or spread some water on the edges and then seal.</li>

            <li>Dust some flour on the stuffed aloo ka paratha and start rolling.</li>
            <li>Roll the paratha into a round about 7 to 8 inches in diameter, or about the size of a normal roti or chapati.</li>
            <li>Pinch off a medium ball of dough. Roll it between your palms and lightly flatten it. Dust with some flour and roll to a circle about 5 to 5.5 inches diameter.</li>
            <li>Take the edge and start pleating, joining the pleats in the center.</li>
            <li>When all of the pleats are joined together, it should look like a Chinese dumpling. Be sure to pinch the pleats together very well so the filling doesn’t leak out while rolling.</li>
            <li>Press the joined top portion slightly downward to flatten it a bit.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some flour and roll this version of stuffed paratha to about the same size as that of a chapati or roti. If some of the filling comes out, then just take a small piece of dough and cover the gap.</li>
            <h2>Make Aloo Paratha</h2>
            <li>On a hot tawa (skillet or griddle), place the rolled paratha. The tawa should be quite hot; cooking parathas at a low flame will harden them. Ideally, the finished parathas are crisp as well as soft.</li>
            <li>When the base is partly cooked, flip the paratha using a spatula. You will see some air pockets on this side.</li>
            <li>Spread some ghee or a neutral flavored oil (e.g. sunflower) on the partly cooked part.</li>
            <li>Flip again and you will see nice golden blisters on the second side. To clarify, the side which has been spread with ghee will be on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Spread some ghee on the second side facing you. A well-made and well-roasted alu paratha will always puff up when roasting.</li>
            <li>Flip again once or twice till both sides are cooked properly, with crisp brown spots. You should also press the alu paratha edges down with a spatula or spoon so that they are fried well. Repeat, making all parathas this way.</li>
        </ol>
