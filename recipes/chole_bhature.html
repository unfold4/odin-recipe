    </ol>              


    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <h3>Pressure cooking chole for chole masala</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>For pressure cooking kabuli chana for the Punjabi chole recipe, take a deep bowl, add the kabuli chana and cover them with enough water. Cover it with a lid and keep aside to soak for 8 hours. If you are in a hurry and do not have much time then you can soak them in hot water and cover it. It will be done in 4 hours. </li>
    <li>Drain well using a strainer. Keep aside.</li>
    <li>Take a small piece of muslin cloth.</li>
    <li>Put the tea leaves in it.</li>
    <li>And tie it tightly. Keep aside.</li>
    <li>In a pressure cooker, add the kabuli chana.</li>
    <li>Add the salt.</li>
    <li>Add the muslin cloth tied bag.</li>
    <li>Add enough water.</li>
    <li>Mix it well.</li>
    <li>Pressure cook it for 3 whistles. Allow the steam to escape before opening the lid. Remove the tea muslin cloth. </li>
    <li>Drain the kabuli chana well using a strainer. You can reserve the water and use it later while cooking at a later stage.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Making Punjabi Chole masala gravy</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>For the Punjabi chole masala gravy, heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan and add the cumin seeds.</li>
    <li>Allow the cumin seeds to crackle, it will take 30 seconds. Do not overdo it as the cumin seeds will burn. Add the onions.</li>
    <li>Add the ginger. We have added finely chopped ginger as it gives a better flavour. Always use a very sharp knife to chop ingredients finely. </li>
    <li>Add the garlic. This gives a great taste and a must to use unless you are a jain do not add it.</li>   
    <li>Sauté on a medium flame for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the chole masala, this can be bought readymade from any grocery store or super market but, if you wish you can also make it at home following this easy recipe for Chole masala powder.</li>
    <li>Add the chilli powder.</li>
    <li>Add the dried mango powder. You can also use lemon juice or anardana as a substitute.</li>
    <li>Add the turmeric powder.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, add the coriander powder. </li>
    <li>Add the cumin seeds powder and salt.</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup of water. At this stage, you can also make use of the water in which the kabuli chana was pressure cooked.</li>
    <li>Mix well and cook on a medium flame for 1 to 2 minutes, stir it once in between.</li>
    <li>Add the kabuli chana.</li>
    <li>Mix well and cook on a medium flame for 5 to 7 minutes, stir it in between.</li>
    <li>Mash the kabuli chana once lightly using a masher, do not over mash it. This light mashing thickens the gravy and gives a great taste. Your Punjabi chole is now ready!</li>
    <li>Also, you can add little coriander if you want. Mix well and keep aside.</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <h3>For the aloo bhatura:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>For the aloo bhatura, in a deep bowl, add the plain flour. Always sieve the flour and then use to avoid any dirt. </li>
    <li>Add the potatoes. This is added to give softness to the dough. Do not mash them, if a bigger lump remains then the bhatura might not roll or alternatively, tear while frying.</li>
    <li>Add the curd. This is added as we have not used yeast. </li>
    <li>Add the oil and salt.</li>
    <li>Add water little by little and knead into a soft dough. </li>
    <li>Our aloo bhatura dough is ready!</li>
    <li>Cover it with a wet muslin cloth and keep in a warm place for 20 minutes. We have used a wet muslin cloth so that the dough does not dry up.</li>
    <li>Remove the muslin cloth. Divide the aloo bhatura dough into 8 equal portions.</li>
    <li>Roll a portion of the dough into a 150 mm. (6”) diameter circle using a little plain flour for rolling. </li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan, deep-fry the aloo bhatura one at time. Till it turns golden brown in colour form both the sides. While frying the bhaturas press the centre lightly with a frying spoon so as to help it puff up. </li>
    <li>Drain aloo bhatura on an absorbent paper. Keep aside.</li>
    </ol>
            
    <h3>How to serve chole bhature:</h3>
